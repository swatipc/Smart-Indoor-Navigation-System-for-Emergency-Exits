# Smart-Indoor-Navigation-System-for-Emergency-Exits

Now-a-days we use Google Maps while traveling. It is useful for outdoor locations. However, GPS which enables location tracking in outdoors, does not help much in case of indoor environments. 
In emergency, it is necessary for each individual to reach to the safe exit in short amount of time avoiding the unsafe places. If the location is new for someone, it becomes difficult for them to reach to the safe exit without help. 
This inspired us to work on this project. It is a mobile application which enables users to reach to the safe exit ensuring thier safety. When emergency occurs, this application send notification to user in their mobile device. Once they click on the notification, this application shows the path from current user location to the safe exit. It also enables user to track his/her current location in application. 

This directory consists of the machine learning model develped for indoor navigation in diferrent cases.
